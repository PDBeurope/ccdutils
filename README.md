# ccd_utils

* A set of python tools to deal with PDB chemical components definitions
  for small molecules, taken from the 
  [wwPDB Chemical Component Dictionary](https://www.wwpdb.org/data/ccd)
  
  
* Program that
  * Reads in a PDB chemical components definition
  * Produces a decent 2D image of the molecule in svg format
  * Image should have options for PDB atom labels, hydrogen atoms and 
    possibly stereo chemistry
  * In addition should be able to write mol/sdf file, mol2 file 
  (possibly ?), pdb (?) and maybe others of the component.
* Program will use rdkit http://www.rdkit.org/
* idea to use in PDBeChem http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe-srv/pdbechem/
