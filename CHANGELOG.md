# Changelog

## RELEASE 0.8.5 - May 26, 2024

### Features
* Updated for RDKit 2023.09.6
* Removed the formal charge adjustment for valence issues, instead uses Dative bonds
* Uses Zero bond type (dotted lines) for depiction of coordinate bonds
* Changes Dative bonds to single bonds for inchi calculation
* Corrected the format of PDB files
* Corrected the header of SDF file

### Breaking changes
* Removed smile from SubstructureMapping and added mol

## RELEASE 0.8.0 - July 26, 2023

### Features
* Added clc_reader and clc_writer to read and write Covalently Linked Components (CLCs)
* Added prd_reader and prd_writer to read and write Protein Reference Dictionarys (PRDs)
* Added boundmolecule_cli, a pipeline to infer CLCs from PDB model files

## RELEASE 0.7.0 - February 26, 2023

### Features
* Replaced pdbecif with gemmi for mmcif parsing
